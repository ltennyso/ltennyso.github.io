# Planning User Journey and Experiences for Content Focused Sites

The concept of a “user journey” or a “marketing funnel” may be familiar to you. Both are key concepts to think about when planning and creating websites. As a content creator, though, I tend to hear them referred to in terms of selling a product, rather than trying to maintain a content-focused site (such as a blog). So, here’s a quick and easy tutorial on these two important concepts, focusing on the content advertising angle.

## User Journeys

A user journey is the path that a user takes when interacting with a product or service. In the context of a blog or website, a user journey might include the steps a visitor takes from initially searching for a content to exploring your site and ultimately subscribing for updates. Understanding a user’s journey through your site allows you to see the user’s perspective and tailor your marketing efforts accordingly.

Let’s take a look at how a user journey might unfold. We’ll start with a hypothetical user named Avery. Avery is interested in learning about, as an example, information architecture. They want to know what considerations need to be made when designing an information architecture for a website. Avery decides to search the internet for information architecture blog posts on this topic.

When Avery stumbles across a particularly good post, they will move to investigate, learning more about the blog that the post is made on. Let’s say Avery ends up on the site’s about page, learning that the author is very experienced in information architecture and, therefore, a source worthy of some trust. This may lead Avery to delve into other pages around the site, learning more information relevant to their search.

If the blog does a good job, Avery may be convinced this is a content source worth keeping an eye on and referencing later. At this point, Avery is looking for ways to get updates on the blog, ones that work with their existing content consumption methods. Presuming their search is successful, they will sign up for an email list, subscribe to an RSS, or otherwise use whichever other method the site promotes. Avery’s journey has been successful, and has led to future positive content interactions.

As marketers, we need to take a look at how each step in this user journey plays out. Like a hiker on a forest trail, there need to be markers and points of interest along the way to keep the user on the correct path. Should they get lost along the way, we risk losing users as they do not achieve their goal. How do we make sure they don’t get lost? We need to design our websites and pages with various user journeys in mind.

## Marketing Funnels

Marketing funnels can help you plan how to walk a user from hearing of your site to completing whichever goal you wish them to take part in, whether that is signing up for email updates, joining a Patreon, or something else entirely.

While user journeys deal with the user’s side of things, marketing funnels are how you as a creator can think about all the user journeys from a more designer side of things. By combining various user journeys together, we get an idea of the general stages different users might go through on their journeys through our site.

A marketing funnel is a way of visualizing user journeys in stages. The funnel metaphor represents how users will inevitably be lost at each step of the process, with only a percent of those who visit reaching their goal. Keep in mind that not all of this loss is negative. Your user may be looking for something that just does not align with what you are marketing. The goal is to prevent unnecessary loss.

There are many variations of the marketing funnel, depending on your industry and what makes sense for your team. Today, we’re going to go over a very basic one: awareness, interest, desire, action, success.

| Stage | Meaning | Related Concepts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| awareness | the user has heard of us | SEO |
| interest | the user wants to know more | content connections |
| desire | the user wants to know the next steps | sitewide navigation, CTAs |
| action | the user is taking steps to be involved | user experience |
| success | the user has completed the goal |   |

Using our example of Avery above, we can see the awareness stage when Avery is searching for content online. To capture them in the first stage of the funnel, we would need to ensure our blog shows up in search results, or that it is well represented on social media. Anything that serves to get the word out that our site exists is a boon to this stage.

As soon as Avery discovered the site, they entered the interest stage as they sought to learn more about the site and the content on it. In this stage, we are most interested in making sure our blog is appealing to users, that information is easily discoverable from any page of the site, and that we are showcasing as many captivating points to continue to as we can (within reason, of course).

Once Avery is interested in continuing to get updates on our blog, they enter the desire stage. At this point, Avery wants specifics on how to get updates. Having easy calls to action that point to ways to keep in touch will go a long way.

After Avery starts these calls to action, they enter the action phase. This step can be complicated. For a store, users can get lost, for example, simply because their wallet was on the other side of the room and they didn’t want to get up. The loss points for a blog are more like “I don’t check my email and I see no other options for updates.” Preventing user loss involves covering your bases and making sure things are as easy to use as possible.

Once Avery has signed up, they are at the success stage. They are what we would call a “conversion,” someone who has completed the transition from visitor to customer, to fall back to more commercial-minded language. Ideally this is where a savvy marketer will aim to preserve loyalty by maintaining contact with the user and continuing positive experiences. In the long run, this will lead to Avery entering other marketing funnels, as we market other opportunities to them, and so the marketing life cycle continues.

## Utilizing This with Your Sites

By understanding the user journey and the marketing funnel, you can create targeted campaigns that address the needs and concerns of potential users at each stage of the journey. Here are some steps to consider:

**Define user personas:** Define user personas based on your target audiences. This will help you understand how users might interact with the website and design journeys that meet everyone’s needs.

**Define the goal of your content:** Determine the overall goal of your page (or series of pages) and consider the journey your user would take to achieve that goal. What do you want your users to do on each page? What information do you want them to find?

**Map the journey:** Lay out the intended journey step-by-step. Make sure the journey is clear and easy to follow, with clear calls to action and visual cues to guide users through the content.

**Analyze user behavior:** Take a look at your metrics at every step of the user journey to identify areas for improvement. Using analytics tools, you can track things like where users click and how long they stay on each page. Use this information to make data-driven decisions to optimize the user experience.

**Optimize for mobile:** With more and more users accessing websites on mobile devices, it is essential to design user journeys that are optimized for mobile. Make sure the user journey is just as easy to follow on small screens!
